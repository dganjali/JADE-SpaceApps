Predictive analytics and serving of satellites

General dashboard/use-case: anomaly detection

Specific Demo of Use-Case: Power Supply Health and RUL Predictions (NASA PCoE (prognostic centre of intelligence) battery lifecycle dataset)
https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/li-ion-battery-aging-datasets?
Specific detection case to avoid power-system failure; life extension with scheduled replacement batteries
Health metric/RUL regressor → threshold → triggers robotic battery replace
Arm task: repeatable pick-and-place of a 3D-printed battery cassette; latch/unlatch and insert a fresh module.


External service docks with pattery to conduct maintenance (e.g. battery swap), more commercially likely 
Gazebo Simulation (may revert to NVIDIA Isaac Sim): simulate docking and rendezvous
Physical Demo: battery pick & place + verification (could use CV to verify setup)
Dashboard: anomalies + health condition, data
