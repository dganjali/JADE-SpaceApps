# Movement Logic Improvements V3
## Date: October 5, 2025

## Major Changes Made

### üéØ 1. **Proper Interception Algorithm**
Previously, the controller was trying to chase the dock's current position, which is ineffective for a moving target. Now it predicts where the dock will be and intercepts it.

#### Key Implementation:
```cpp
// Calculate time to intercept
timeToIntercept = dist / max(relSpeed, 0.5);

// Predicted dock position (lead the target)
predictedDockPos = dockPose.Pos() + vDock * timeToIntercept;

// Aim for intercept point, not current position
interceptError = predictedDockPos - targetPose.Pos();
```

**Result**: Chaser now leads the target instead of chasing from behind.

### üõë 2. **Improved Emergency Braking**
The braking logic was triggering too late and too aggressively.

#### Changes:
- **Trigger distance**: Increased from `2.0x` to `4.0x` reach distance
- **Trigger velocity**: Reduced from `0.8 m/s` to `0.5 m/s` (earlier braking)
- **Graduated braking**: Strength scales with approach velocity and proximity
- **Smoother control**: No longer abrupt "all or nothing" braking

```cpp
// Before: Only braked when very close and very fast
if (dist < reachDistance * 2.0 && approachVel > 0.8)

// After: Graduated braking starting earlier
if (dist < reachDistance * 4.0 && approachVel > 0.5)
  brakingStrength = min(approachVel / 0.5, 2.0)
  proximityScale = 2.0 - (dist / (reachDistance * 2.0))
```

---

### üìê 3. **Adaptive Control Gains**
Control gains now scale based on distance to target for smoother approach.

```cpp
// Distance-based scaling
if (dist < 8.0) {
  approachPhase = 1.0 - (dist / 8.0);  // 0 at 8m, 1 at 0m
  distanceScale = 0.3 + 0.7 * (1.0 - approachPhase);  // 100% at 8m+, 30% at 0m
}

// Apply scaled gains
positionForce = kp * distanceScale * interceptError;
dampingForce = -kd * distanceScale * velocityError;
```

**Benefits**:
- Full power when far away (fast approach)
- Reduced power when close (gentle docking)
- Smooth transition between phases

---

### üéØ 4. **Velocity Matching Logic**
Added explicit velocity matching when close to dock for smoother rendezvous.

```cpp
if (dist < reachDistance * 3.0) {
  // Reduce force based on approach velocity
  if (approachVel > 0.3) {
    softScale = 0.3 / max(approachVel, 0.31);
  }
  
  // Add explicit velocity matching
  matchingForce = (vDock - vTarget) * mass * 0.5;
  force = force * softScale + matchingForce;
}
```

**Result**: Chaser actively tries to match dock's velocity for soft docking.

### ‚öôÔ∏è 5. **Optimized Parameters**

#### Controller Gains:
| Parameter | Old Value | New Value | Reason |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| `kp` | 1.0 | 1.8 | Better tracking of moving target |
| `kd` | 1.5 | 2.2 | More damping for smooth approach |
| `maxForce` | 8.0 N | 12.0 N | Sufficient acceleration for interception |
| `reachDistance` | 0.8 m | 0.6 m | More realistic docking threshold |

#### Dock Parameters:
| Parameter | Old Value | New Value | Reason |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| `dockThrustForce` | 3.5 N | 4.0 N | Moderate challenge, not too fast |
| `maxDockSpeed` | 0.25 m/s | 0.35 m/s | More dynamic scenario |

---

### üîß 6. **Better Debug Output**
Enhanced console output to track controller performance:

```cpp
std::cout << "[ThrusterController] dist=" << dist 
          << " interceptDist=" << interceptDist
          << " approachVel=" << approachVel 
          << " phase=" << approachPhase
          << " vTarget=" << vTarget.Length() 
          << " vDock=" << vDock.Length()
          << " force=" << forceMag << "N" << std::endl;
```

Shows:
- Current distance to dock
- Distance to intercept point
- Approach velocity (closing speed)
- Approach phase (0=far, 1=close)
- Both velocities
- Applied force magnitude

## Expected Behavior

### Phase 1: Far Approach (8m+)
- **Gains**: 100% (full power)
- **Strategy**: Aggressive pursuit toward intercept point
- **Force**: Up to 12N
- **Focus**: Close distance quickly

### Phase 2: Medium Approach (3-8m)
- **Gains**: Scaling down (100% ‚Üí 30%)
- **Strategy**: Maintained pursuit with increasing caution
- **Force**: Gradually reducing
- **Focus**: Balance speed and control

### Phase 3: Close Approach (0.6-3m)
- **Gains**: 30-70%
- **Strategy**: Soft approach with velocity matching
- **Force**: Heavily reduced, scaled by approach velocity
- **Focus**: Match dock velocity for gentle contact

### Phase 4: Braking (if needed)
- **Trigger**: Within 4x reach distance AND approaching > 0.5 m/s
- **Strategy**: Graduated braking based on speed and proximity
- **Force**: Up to 70% max force (scaled)
- **Focus**: Prevent collision

### Phase 5: Success
- **Criteria**: 
  - Distance ‚â§ 0.6m
  - Approach velocity < 0.15 m/s
  - Relative speed < 0.25 m/s
- **Result**: Docking complete! üéâ

## Key Improvements Summary

2. ‚úÖ **Earlier, smoother braking** - Prevents overshoot
3. ‚úÖ **Adaptive control gains** - Smooth transition from pursuit to docking
4. ‚úÖ **Explicit velocity matching** - Gentle final approach
5. ‚úÖ **Optimized parameters** - Better balance of speed and control
6. ‚úÖ **Enhanced debugging** - Better visibility into controller behavior

## Testing Instructions

```bash
cd /Users/dganjali/GitHub/JADE-SpaceApps/gazebo_new
./run_simulation.sh
```

Watch for:
1. **Initial pursuit**: Chaser accelerates toward intercept point
2. **Mid-flight adjustment**: Chaser leads the moving dock
3. **Approach phase**: Gradual deceleration as it gets closer
4. **Velocity matching**: Chaser matches dock's motion
5. **Success message**: Console confirms docking achieved

---

## Troubleshooting

### If chaser overshoots:
- Increase `kd` (more damping)
- Decrease `kp` (less aggressive)
- Lower `maxForce`

### If chaser doesn't catch up:
- Increase `kp` (more aggressive pursuit)
- Increase `maxForce`
- Check `max_dock_speed` isn't too high

### If approach is too slow:
- Increase `kp` for far distances
- Reduce braking trigger distance
- Increase `maxForce`

### If contact is too hard:
- Increase `kd` (more damping)
- Make success criteria stricter (lower velocities)
- Reduce gains at close range (adjust distanceScale)
