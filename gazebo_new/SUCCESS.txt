echo "=================================================="
echo ""
echo "✅ All systems configured and built successfully!"
echo ""
echo "📁 Project Structure:"
echo "   - Plugin: build/libthruster_controller.dylib"
echo "   - Models: dock (orange) & chaser (blue)"  
echo "   - World: LEO zero-gravity environment"
echo ""
echo "🎮 To run the simulation:"
echo "   ./run_simulation.sh"
echo ""
echo "📊 What to expect:"
echo "   • Chaser starts 5m away from dock"
echo "   • Dock moves with random velocity (~0.2 m/s)"
echo "   • PD controller guides chaser to intercept"
echo "   • Watch console for distance updates"
echo "   • Success when distance < 0.3m"
echo ""
echo "⚙️  Controls in Gazebo:"
echo "   • Left-drag: Rotate view"
echo "   • Right-drag: Pan"
echo "   • Scroll: Zoom"
echo "   • Play/Pause button: Control simulation"
echo ""
echo "🔧 Tuning: Edit worlds/leo.sdf to adjust:"
echo "   • kp/kd gains (controller aggressiveness)"
echo "   • max_force (thruster power limit)"
