MVP — Predictive Analytics & Robotic Battery Servicing for LEO Satellites
Problem Statement
Battery failures are mission-critical: High-value LEO satellites (EO, SAR, communications, government) can fail instantly if power systems degrade unexpectedly.


Current maintenance is costly or impossible: Most satellites are not designed for easy replacement, and launching replacements or backup satellites is expensive.


Predictive maintenance gap: Operators lack accessible, real-time analytics to schedule maintenance before degradation becomes catastrophic.



Proposed Solution
Predictive analytics + robotic servicing: Monitor satellite telemetry, predict battery RUL, and automatically trigger maintenance actions (battery replacement for MVP)


Hybrid approach for feasibility:


Simulation: Gazebo models docking/rendezvous to show realistic servicing workflow.


Physical demo: Bench 3-DOF robotic arm performs battery pick-and-place and verification on mock satellite.


Closed-loop system: Detect → Decide → Act → Verify, demonstrated in real-time dashboard.



Business Model / Commercial Rationale
Target customers: High-value satellites where downtime costs are large enough to justify maintenance services.


Revenue model:


Subscription for predictive analytics (RUL monitoring, anomaly alerts).


Per-service fee for battery swaps or other modular maintenance.


Managed O&M contracts combining analytics + physical servicing.


Value proposition:


Reduces unplanned mission downtime.


Extends satellite lifetime.


Provides predictable, scalable revenue streams for service operators.


Competitive advantage: Bench demo proves that predictive RUL can reliably trigger maintenance, lowering risk and cost before full-scale external servicing deployment.



Demo / Technical Highlights
Telemetry & RUL: NASA SMAP/MSL anomaly dataset + NASA PCoE Li-ion battery dataset.


Robotic arm: 3-DOF pick-and-place on 3D-printed battery cassettes.


Verification: INA219 voltage/current, latch switches, optional computer vision.


Dashboard: Shows anomalies, battery health, maintenance events, and verification logs.



MVP Goal
 Demonstrate a realistic, commercially relevant workflow: predictive analytics triggers maintenance → simulated docking → physical arm executes swap → verification completes the loop.
